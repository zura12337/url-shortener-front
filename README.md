### Home Page

##### I decided to make home page simple, with just one input and list of generated links. You can copy shortened URL from home page and also see statistics for your generated URL.

### Statistics Page

##### On statistics page you can see some graphs. how many times user clicked your shortened link, unique users and more... Also on header you can see original URL Meta data , title and image (if available). 

### Redirect Page

##### On this page website sends request to get original URL by short ID, If current URL is disabled, removed, or just can not be found, website displays error message, otherwise you will be redirected to original URL.

### Visited Links Page

##### On visited links page website displays all URL that you clicked, including removed and disabled ones. You can filter removed URLs and show only active and paused URLs.
